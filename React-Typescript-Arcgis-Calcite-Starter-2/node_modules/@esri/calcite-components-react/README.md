# Calcite Components React

A set of React components that wrap [Calcite Components](https://esri.github.io/calcite-components/).

## Installation

```
npm install --save @esri/calcite-components-react
```

This package includes the compatible version of the main component library as a dependency, so no need to install `@esri/calcite-components` separately.

## Use

Much like using the standard calcite-components package, you'll need to define the elements on the window first:

```jsx
import { applyPolyfills, defineCustomElements } from "@esri/calcite-components/dist/loader";

// if you're supporting older browsers, apply polyfills
applyPolyfills().then(() => {
  // define the custom tags on the window
  defineCustomElements(window);
  // after these are defined, render your app as you would normally
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
});
```

To ensure the theme works, import the global stylesheet into your app (only do this once):

```js
import "@esri/calcite-components/dist/calcite/calcite.css";
```

Then import any components you'd like to use:

```js
import { CalciteAvatar, CalciteButton, CalciteIcon, CalciteSlider } from "@esri/calcite-components-react";
```

## Static Assets

Some components (icon, date-picker) rely on assets being available at a particular path. You'll need to copy these over to your public folder for them to work properly. Something like:

```sh
cp -r node_modules/@esri/calcite-components/dist/calcite/assets/* ./public/assets/
```

## Why not just use the web components directly?

Because React uses a synthetic event system, the custom events emitted from calcite components won't work with JSX in React. For example, say you want to update some value when the `calcite-slider` component changes. When using the standard web components, you need to save a ref to the element, and add a listener:

```jsx
const sliderEl = useRef(null);
const [sliderValue, setSliderValue] = useState(50);

function onUpdate(event) {
  setSliderValue(event.target.value);
}

// need to access the dom node to set custom event listeners or props that aren't strings / numbers
// https://stenciljs.com/docs/react#properties-and-events
useEffect(
  (_) => {
    sliderEl.current.addEventListener("calciteSliderUpdate", onUpdate);
  },
  [sliderEl]
);
```

Using calcite-components-react, these events are connected for you:

```jsx
const [sliderValue, setSliderValue] = useState(50);
<CalciteSlider onCalciteSliderUpdate={(e) => setSliderValue(e.target.value)} />;
```

If you're using TypeScript, you'll also get increased type safety for your event listeners, props, etc.
